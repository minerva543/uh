# MVA

A tutorial for simple application of MVA, primarily through TMVA. The script trains a BDT, opens the diagnostic file for the BDT, applies the BDT to some sample data, and plots the data with a few example BDT cuts applied. See the annotated code in python/runme.py

## Running
  * source setup.sh # This is if you are running on the imperial machines
